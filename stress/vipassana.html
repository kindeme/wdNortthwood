				<h1>Mindfulness: The practice of vipassana</h1>
				<img src="../images/vipassana.jpg" alt="vipassana" />
				<div>
					<p>
						Vipassana is a quality of mind generally referred to as
						mindfulness. Mindfulness is a state of open and
						nonjudgmental attention to the contents of
						consciousness. Cultivating this quality of mind has been
						shown to moderate pain, relieve anxiety and depression,
						improve cognitive function.
					</p>
					<p>
						It may sound easy to sit quietly and remove your mind of
						distraction, but when you begin practicing vipassana,
						you'll find that distraction is the normal condition of
						the mind. In todays fast-paced world, it's harder than
						ever to train the mind to break through these continuous
						distractions. Meditation is a technique for doing just
						this. The goal is to enjoy a mind that is undisturbed by
						worry and to become effortlessly aware of the flow of
						experience in the present.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is no time limit on meditation. You can start with
						a 5-minute meditation session once a month, spend an
						hour a day meditating, or anything in between. This is
						your practice, your journey, and you proceed at your
						pace. Regardless of how long or how often you practice
						vipassana, you will always receive its benefits.
					</p>
				</div>
				<h1>How to begin practicing vipassana</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Sit comfortably, with your spine erect, either in a
						chair or cross-legged on a cushion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and feel the
						points of contact between your body and the chair or
						floor. Notice the sensations associated with sitting,
						such as feelings of pressure, warmth, tingling, or
						vibration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Gradually become aware of the process of breathing. Pay
						attention to wherever you feel the breath most clearly
						either at the nostrils or in the rising and falling your
						abdomen.
					</li>
					<li>
						Allow your attention to rest in the mere sensation of
						breathing. Don t try to control your breath. Just let it
						come and go naturally.
					</li>
					<li>
						Every time your mind wanders in thought, gently return
						it to the sensation of breathing.
					</li>
					<li>
						As you focus on your breathing, you will notice that
						other perceptions and sensations continue to appear:
						sounds, feelings in the body, emotions. Notice these
						phenomena as they come into your field of awareness, and
						then return to the sensation of breathing.
					</li>
					<li>
						The moment you realize that you have been lost in
						thought, notice the present thought itself as an object
						of consciousness. Then return your attention to your
						breathing or to whatever sounds or sensations arise in
						the next moment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Continue in this way until you can simply witness all
						objects of consciousness sights, sounds, sensations,
						emotions, and even thoughts themselves as they arise and
						pass away.
					</li>
				</ol>
